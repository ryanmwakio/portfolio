## Description:

portfolio site developer and designed by [Ryan Mwakio](https://ryanmwakio.netlify.app/). Motivation behind creating this site was to develop a portfolio that I enjoy looking at. The templates out there weren't giving that so I decided to create this and make it available for everyone. The project is running on purely react with various extra small libraries for functionalities.

## How to install and run the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanmwakio/portfolio.git
```

install all node dependecies

```bash
npm install
```

run project

```bash
npm start
```

## How to use the project

use navigations completely configured with smooth scroll or you can just scroll.
